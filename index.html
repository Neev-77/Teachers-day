<p>Dear Anmol Sir, you have been more than just an instructor—your patience and clarity have helped us turn complex logic into simple solutions. You taught us that mistakes are not failures but steps toward improvement, just like bugs lead us closer to better programs. Thank you for inspiring creativity, problem-solving, and confidence in every line of code we write. 💻✨ 🔬✨</p>

<p>Dear Teacher, thank you for making coding fun and exciting! You never just taught us programming—you showed us how to think differently, solve problems step by step, and not be afraid of errors. Your classes always felt like solving puzzles with friends, and that’s what makes learning with you so special. 💻🙌</p>
